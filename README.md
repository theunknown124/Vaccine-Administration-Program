# Vaccine-Administration-Program
Here is a sippet from the Project Objective:
The objective of our project is to develop a simulated Vaccine Administration
Management System (VAMS) system using the data structures we learned in the class, such as
LinkedList, Stack/Queue, Binary Search Tree. In this system, we would like to implement four
major components: clinician, vaccine recipients, appointment, and administrator.

This project was group orientated.

My responsilities for the project were the Vaccine Recipient and some of the Administrator functions.
